# electronic_affidavit
A facial recognition system created using YOLOv5, MERN, and Flask, and MongoDB.

##Initial Motivation:

YOLOv5 is a well known deep learning model, built around a convolutional neural network and highly capable of recognising and classifying objects into classes preset by the user while training. While it was not explicitly built for face recognition, what if each person was assigned a “class” and the algorithm was trained on this? This was the initial approach for Electronic Affidavit, a web-based application that allows a registered user to detect the identity of any person within the model’s dataset.
